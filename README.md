# 📌Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a bash script that will clone the repo and produce a csv file with the team members' personal information. For this goal no installation is required, however, check if all dependencies are satisfied. Please download the following script `csv-producer.sh`.

>This is the main repository for the Stage_0 task for the `HackBio'2021 Virtual Internship Experience` for #Team-watson. <br>
The utmost priority of this project is to write small scripts in different languages with the output: `name, e-mail, slack_username, biostack, twitter_username and hamming_distance `. Next step is to make a `csv` file with rows corresponding to  the individual team member and columns to the fields (as name, e-mail, etc) from the various generated scripts in the worked on languages. All members of the team will fork the `GitHub REPO` and make the neccesary commits for task for `Stage_0`. This `README`.md contains all the necessary information to replicate the process for this task. <br>

Note: You can select any of the languages that you have seen on the repo

3 align="left"> Here is what your output template shoud look like;</h3>📉📈

You can choose to print out your scripts in different ways. However, here is a well organised template for your scripts📑 output:

```bash
name: *Your full name*
email: *Your e-mail* 
slack_username: @+*username*
biostack: *Name of biostack you chose*
twitter_usernme: *Your twitter username*
hammingdistance: *the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different*
```
Working prototype:
```bash
name: Xxxxxxxx Xxxxxx
email: xxxxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com
slack_username: @Sxxxxxxxx
biostack: genomicsxxxxx
twitter_usernme: @xxxxxxx
hammingdistance: x
```
**When done kindly save or rename your file in this format:<br>** `stage_0_slack-username`
